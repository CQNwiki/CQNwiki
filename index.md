This wiki is at an embryonic state. Partially it exists as an exercise in using git.

So try this:

- go to [`https://krastanov.github.io/CQNwiki`](https://krastanov.github.io/CQNwiki)
- make a fork to your personal github account
- make a clone of the fork locally on your computer | `git clone ...`
- make a new branch | `git branch ...` and `git checkout ...`
- make some commits to that new branch | `git add ...` and `git commit ...`
- push these commits to your github fork | `git push ...`
- make a pull request from that fork so your additions can be included in the wiki

To keep your local repository clone up to date:

- add a new remote | `git remote add ...`
- go to your master/main branch | `git checkout ...`
- pull the most up-to-date state from the upstream | `git pull ...`
